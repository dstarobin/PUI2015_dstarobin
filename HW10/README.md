Please link to the zip files on your local machine. I did not alter them in any way before using them for this hw.

I relied heavily upon the notebooks of several other individuals in the class for this hw, which I found difficult. I most closely followed and took the time to understand jgao's ipynb.

I also ran into a bug in version .15 of scikit that caused it to fail when being applied to a Pandas df. I found that it was a known defect. After upgrading to v .17 as suggested by Federica, it was fixed.
