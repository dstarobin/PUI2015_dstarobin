The JSON associated with both iPython notebooks (for HW3 tasks 1 and 2) in this directory can be copied and run normally. Please pay no attention to the **HW3_task2_dstarobin_prison file without the ipynb extension**. I removed the images from the notebook provided because they prevented the notebook from being rendered on GitHub. There are no special Python libraries used in either notebook.
