Aesthetically, this plot is clean and does not contain many distractions. It's clear in its representation of the data. There are a couple of ways in which it can be improved:

1. Eliminate the redundant values on the upper x-axis and combine both legends into a single item. The months that the x axis represents are the same for both years.
2. Adjust the x-axis values to a more logical interval, like the first and fifteenth rather than the 23rd and 6th, for example.
