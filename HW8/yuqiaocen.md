There's a lot going on in this plot, but the color scheme makes the appropriate distinctions.

Things to improve:

1. Limit x and y axis range so they begin at 0.
2. Add units to axis titles (dollars).
3. Although this is an exact reproduction of what was due for a homework with the colors altered, I wouldn't know what "My regression line" is, or how/ why it's different than the other regression lines. 
4. Add a title.
5. What data is the "analytic regression" done on?
6. The "With" should be removed from "With all incomes".
