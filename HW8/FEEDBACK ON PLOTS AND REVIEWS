your reviews are very critical, which is a great thing, and insightful. 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================

very nice plot that summarize a lot of details at once

labels in the legend top left too small to read

nice unobtrusive labels showing single events

drop rides from the labels on the right for compactness


consider a more compact notation for the y axis: e.g. use units of 1000 rides



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================

==========

good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)


jpmora
======

nice location of the legends in two different spots,

nice proportions, appropriate to display the data without getting distracted by empty space

labels too small

the plot is very busy. 

no point in starting at the negative range: remove the <0 space

two legends for the regression lines and the datapoints may be better: clearer less overwhelming

association of color to rage triggers preconceptions. since you have few categories shapes may be a better choice.
